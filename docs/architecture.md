# Architecture

Midway Weather is a standalone Laravel application for one Ambient Weather station per installation. Its original use is a 1920×1080 kitchen display; the same Blade page adapts to desktop browsers and scrolling mobile layouts. It does not require a Raspberry Pi: the server and display browser can run on separate machines.

## Collection and presentation

1. Laravel's scheduler runs `weather:collect` every minute. The Ambient client requests `/v1/devices`, selects the configured device (or the first account device), normalizes `lastData`, and upserts a minute-rounded observation.
2. `weather:forecast` requests daily Open-Meteo data hourly and upserts forecasts by local date.
3. Each collector records source health. Failures preserve last-good weather data.
4. `weather:cleanup` rebuilds recent daily aggregates before pruning old detailed observations.
5. `/` renders from local SQLite data through `DisplayPresenter`; the browser polls `/api/display/weather`, normally every 60 seconds. Browser polling does not collect from Ambient.
6. The browser loads Stadia Maps base tiles and optional latest-frame RainViewer radar independently. Public map interaction is disabled for a stable display; admin controls set framing.

## Persistence and configuration

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `observations` | Minute-deduplicated normalized readings plus raw provider payload |
| `daily_summaries` | Local-day aggregates retained beyond detailed observations |
| `forecast_days` | Daily forecasts, retained across failed refreshes |
| `collection_statuses` | Provider success/failure state |
| `weather_settings` | Central presentation configuration with revision checking |

SQLite uses WAL mode, NORMAL synchronous mode, and a five-second busy timeout by default. Keep the database and its directory writable for SQLite sidecars. File cache and sessions, plus the synchronous queue driver, avoid additional daemons.

Environment/configuration provides initial defaults and credentials. Saved settings override the supported presentation defaults. `WeatherSettings` applies the same settings to server rendering and JSON polling. Unsaved authenticated previews use the real presenter without persisting settings, polling saved configuration, registering a service worker, or modifying live quip rotation.

## HTTP boundaries

| GET route | Purpose | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Main dashboard | Public |
| `/display/weather` | Compatibility entry point | Public |
| `/api/display/weather` | Display-specific view model | Public |
| `/api/v1/summary/current` | Existing compact ecosystem summary | Public |
| `/api/v2/summary/current` | Canonical weather summary | Public |
| `/api/v1/forecast/daily` | Daily forecast projection | Public |
| `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/version` | Operational contracts | Public |
| `/manifest.webmanifest` | PWA metadata | Public |
| `/up` | Laravel boot/liveness | Public |
| `/admin`, `/admin/diagnostics` | Configuration and diagnostics | Administrator session |

Admin writes, previews, lookup, refresh, and logout use protected POST routes with CSRF validation. See [administrator setup](configuration.md#administrator-setup). Display JSON is an unversioned presentation model and includes configured location/map coordinates. Canonical APIs intentionally separate consumer contracts from display-specific information; see [Weather v2](contracts/weather-v2.md).

## Code map and extension points

- `app/Weather/Clients/`: provider HTTP integrations.
- `app/Weather/Services/`: collection, retention, trends, summaries, presentation.
- `app/Weather/Configuration/WeatherSettings.php`: registered tiles and saved settings.
- `app/Weather/Configuration/WeatherSources.php`: normalized source diagnostics.
- `app/Weather/Support/`: formatting, conditions, phrases, temperature moods, sparklines.
- `resources/views/display/tiles/`: tile partials.
- `config/weather_themes.php`: seasonal theme registry.
- `public/display/`, `public/admin-assets/`: browser assets; no frontend compilation.
- `routes/console.php`: schedules and heartbeat.

New tiles can register supported sizes and a render partial. Newly registered tiles remain inactive in existing saved layouts. Pool Temperature demonstrates the extension slot without fabricating a sensor reading.
